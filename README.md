# Versus (Working title)
Multiplayer mobile game

Developed by BF and KH

The premise of Versus is to incorporate multiple mini games into one app.

Potential mini games include:
-Trivia
-Racing
-Poker

The concept is for one person to own the app act as a host for a game. The app
will generate an access code for the lobby. Players will then enter the code into
a website to join the lobby, without having to download or buy the app, and play
the game.

The itent is to have people play games together while in a group setting, such as
at a restaurant/bar, public transportation, etc.

Features include:
-Location based game themes
    -Local trivia, poker table theme, etc
-Public "ping" to alert other app owners of a game starting
    -Location based, only alerting others within a certain distance
